## About
The project was developed for the [Computer Graphics and Interactive Systems](https://www.cse.uoi.gr/course/computer-graphics-and-interactive-systems/?lang=en) course @ [cse.uoi.gr](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/)

The purpose of the this OpenGL Programming Exercise is to practice the use of basic libraries for elementary graphics in OpenGL 3.3 (and later versions) that support 2D and 3D graphics.
In this exercise, one will create an application in which fireballs fall from the sky and collide with the ground.
